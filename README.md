# mri
See User Manual for extended details and instructions
Implements 2 MATLAB GUIs:

radial_recon: performs a special form of MRI image reconstruction

phantom_create: creates phantom "raw" data for reconstruction app, as well as how the phantom should look (approximately) when reconstructed

3D viewers: 

-vi: edited version of the vi viewer (used in program). 

-imshow3D (unused, but there if desired)

old_code: previous, non-GUI version of code (before I started working on this)

Data/Lots of Data: sample data for reconstruction (all the same)

3dRotation: used to rotate matrices in 3 dimensions
